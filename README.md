# TrustChain_Walmart
📌 Problem
In today’s large-scale retail environments, threats happen every second — from credential stuffing and bot scalping, to API abuse and supply chain tampering.
While detection exists, real-time response and verifiable trust are lacking.

🎯 Solution Summary
Build a system that:

🛡️ Detects threats in real time — login abuse, bot behavior, malicious requests

🚨 Takes autonomous actions (block IP, revoke token, rate limit)

🔗 Logs every incident/action to a private blockchain ledger for transparency, integrity, and auditability

🧩 Key Features
Layer	Component
🔍 Detection	Rule-based + ML threat scoring engine (anomaly detection, bot fingerprinting)
⚡ Response	Automatic IP blocking, token invalidation, session lockdown
📈 Monitoring	Real-time dashboard (alerts, metrics)
🔐 Auditability	All security events logged in a private Ethereum chain or Hyperledger Fabric
🔑 Trust Layer	Immutable log of who did what, when — supports compliance, retail audits, post-breach investigations
